# KUAccess

This project holds the HTML and CSS files neccessary to produce the KU Access website.

It holds the infrastructure for a website and an Android phone app, built for the University of Kansas, to increase the accessibility of information on reporting accessibility
barriers to KU for the purposes of meeting ADA standards.

This file will be updated as code is finalized, providing instructions on what changes should be made to the code to adapt the build for outside organizations.
